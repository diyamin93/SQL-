# SQL Basics – Company Database Project

Welcome to the **SQL Basics** repository! This project is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of SQL through hands-on examples. It includes the creation of a simple company database and demonstrates how to use SQL `JOIN` operations to query data across multiple tables.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

- Basic SQL syntax
- Creating databases and tables
- Inserting data into tables
- Querying data using `SELECT`
- Filtering data using `WHERE`
- Joining tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and more

## 🏢 Project Overview

In this project, we simulate a basic **company database** that includes the following tables:

- **Employees** – stores employee information
- **Branches** – stores branch details
- **clients** – contain clients records
- **working details** – tracks which employees are assigned to which projects

Using this schema, we practice writing various SQL queries including multi-table joins.
